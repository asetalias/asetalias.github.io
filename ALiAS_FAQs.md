let us know which field you want to work, and we will guide you thereafter. Have one plan at a time.

Q6. Best OS?
Ans. Are you a designer? - Windows; Are you a developer? - Linux(Any)
Windows has great graphics. It spoon feeds you everything. Many design softwares, games, drivers and
support is easily available in windows. Installing anything is a cup of cake for anyone. But if you want
to delve into softwares deeper, please forget your games and ease. Being open source community, we
recommend installing Linux as dual boot, and get into ease with it. The only difference you will see in
different distros is the GUI. Some software packages and libraries are pre-installed in some distros,
while some requires you to install. Install Ubuntu or Linux Mint if you are a beginner. Ubuntu has got
best support for you. (Pro-tip: Give more space to Home directory as all your files are installed here).

Q7. The language I should start with?
Ans. Start with C++. Next learn JAVA, then Python. This will fulfill most of your software needs and
problems.

P.S. - Please DON’T ASK TO ASK, JUST ASK. We all are learners here, and all of us are noobs in
some field or the other. Don’t be shy. If you don’t know, just admit it, and ask and learn to be better
you.
